# Task02Kotlin

This is a basic app which uses **OSM**.
====================================

In order to make use of this app:

1. *The user should first download a certain map area
from any osm supporting application or website*.

2. The tiles should be saved(downloaded) to sdcard/osmdroid folder.
(This usually happens automatically.)

That's it!

The application will now track you according to your location on the map
and follow your location as well.

You don't need to have access to the internet for your location to update
on the map now.

TESTING THE CODE

In order to be able to test this code, appropriate maps should be
